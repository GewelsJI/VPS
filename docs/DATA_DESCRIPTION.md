# The Descriptions of SUN-SEG Dataset 

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/video_v2-min.gif"/> <br />
</p>

We first introduce a high-quality per-frame annotated VPS dataset, named SUN-SEG, which includes 158,690 frames from the famous SUN dataset. We extend the labels with diverse types, i.e., object mask, boundary, scribble, polygon, and visual attribute. We also introduce the pathological informations from the original [SUN dataset](http://sundatabase.org/), including pathological classification labels, location information, and shape information. 

Notably, the origin SUN dataset has 113 colonoscopy videos, including 100 positive cases with 49, 136 polyp frames and 13 negative cases with 109, 554 non-polyp frames. We manually trim them into 378 positive and 728 negative short clips, meanwhile maintaining their intrinsic consecutive relationship. Such data pre-processing ensures each clip has around 3~11s duration at a real-time frame rate (i.e., 30 fps), which promotes the fault-tolerant margin for various algorithms and devices. To this end, the re-organized SUN-SEG contains 1, 106 short video clips with 158, 690 video frames totally, offering a solid foundation to build a representative benchmark.

As such, it yeilds the final version of our SUN-SEG dataset, which includes 49,136 polyp frames (i.e., postive part) and 109,554 non-polyp frames (i.e., negative part) taken from  different 285 and 728 colonoscopy videos clips, as well as the corresponding annotations. The following sections will provide details about our SUN-SEG point-by-point.

# File Tree Organization

The `Frame` folder contains the frames and the rest folders contain the corresponding ground truth. As for the `bbox_annotation.json` and `classfication.txt` text file, we follow the same format as COCO and ImageNet for generality.

# Dataset Statistics

Figure 1 (left) shows the statistic distributions for pathological patterns excluding non-polyp (NP). We find that well-differentiated or low-grade adenoma are dominated but are difficult to locate due to low-intensity contrast between the lesion and mucosal surface. Figure 1 (right) shows the multi-dependencies among pathological pattern, shape, and location of colon polyp.

# Label Description

##  3. <a name='Label-I:CategoryClassificationAnnotation'></a>Label-I: Category Classification Annotation

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/classification-min.png"/> <br />
</p>

Here are seven classes of pathological diagnosis:

- Low-grade adenoma (229 videos, 39834 frames)
- High-grade adenoma (26 videos, 4111 frames)
- Hyperplastic polyp (10 videos, 1644 frames)
- Traditional serrated adenoma (9 videos, 1627 frames)
- Sessile serrated lesion (8 videos, 1288 frames)
- Invasive carcinoma (3 videos, 632 frames)
- Non-Polyp (728 videos, 109,554 frames)

The annotation is in `./data/DATASET/classification.txt`. 
In the text file, each row represents a image and its class of pathological diagnosis. 
Here are an example:

    image_dir_00001.jpg	low_grade_adenoma
    image_dir_00002.jpg	hyperplastic_polyp
    image_dir_00003.jpg	sessile_serrated_lesion
    ...

##  4. <a name='Label-II:ObjectMask'></a>Label-II: Object Mask

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/video_v2-min.gif"/> <br />
</p>

In polyp-existing frames, each polyp is annotated with a segmentation mask as shown above. 

The annotation is in `./data/DATASET/GT/`. Each image's name has direct correspondance with the annotation file name. 
For example, the segmentation mask for `image_dir_00001.jpg` is `image_dir_00001.png`.

##  5. <a name='Label-III:BoundingBox'></a>Label-III: Bounding Box

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/bbox-min.gif"/> <br />
</p>

We present the bounding box annotation for each polyp-existing frame. In `./data/DATASET/bbox_annotation.json` file, we follow the same format as COCO dataset. Here are an example of COCO-style annotation:

    {
        'info': {
            'year': 2021, 
            'version': 'v1.0', 
            'description': 'SUN Colonoscopy Video Database. Hayato et al, 2020.', 
            'contributor': '', 
            'url': '', 
            'date_created': ''}, 
        'images': [{
            'id': 'case1_1-a2-image0001', 
            'width': 1158, 
            'height': 1008,
            'case_name': 'case1_1'  # case_name means the name of case in the folder.
            'file_name': 'case_M_20181001100941_0U62372100109341_1_005_001-1_a2_ayy_image0001'}, # file_name is corresponding to the image name in the folder. 
            ...], 
        'annotation': [{
            'id': 'case1_1-a2-image0001', 
            'bbox': [262, 72, 68, 81]},  # Each element represnets the [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y].
            ...]
    }

##  6. <a name='Label-IV:Boundary'></a>Label-IV: Boundary

The annotations are stored in `./data/DATASET/Edge/`. Each image's name has direct correspondance with the annotation file name. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/weak1-min.gif"/> <br />
</p>

##  7. <a name='Label-V:TwoWeakLabelsScribblePolygon'></a>Label-V: Two Weak Labels (Scribble & Polygon)

The annotations are in `./data/DATASET/Scribble/`, and `./data/DATASET/Polygon/`, respectively. Each image's name has direct correspondance with the annotation file name.

> We follow the Narrow Band Imaging International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification criteria. It uses staining, vascular patterns, and surface patterns to distinguish between hyperplastic and adenomatous colon polyps.
