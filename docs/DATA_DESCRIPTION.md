</p>

Our SUN-SEG dataset including 49,136 polyp frames (i.e., postive part) and 109,554 non-polyp frames (i.e., negative part) taken from  different 285 and 728 colonoscopy videos clips, which were densely annotated with diversified labels for each frame, such as object-level segmentation mask, bounding box, category, attribute, and three weak label (ie. edge, scribble , 
polygon). More details refer to SUN dataset: http://sundatabase.org/

The `Frame` folder contains the frames and the rest folders contain the corresponding ground truth. 
As for the `bbox_annotation.json` and `classfication.txt` text file, we follow the same format as COCO and ImageNet for generality.

</p>

### Positive Part

## Label Description

### Label-I: Category Classification Annotation

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/classification-min.png"/> <br />
</p>

Here are seven classes of pathological diagnosis:

- Low-grade adenoma (229 videos, 39834 frames)
- High-grade adenoma (26 videos, 4111 frames)
- Hyperplastic polyp (10 videos, 1644 frames)
- Traditional serrated adenoma (9 videos, 1627 frames)
- Sessile serrated lesion (8 videos, 1288 frames)
- Invasive carcinoma (3 videos, 632 frames)
- Non-Polyp (728 videos, 109,554 frames)

The annotation is in `./data/DATASET/classification.txt`. 
In the text file, each row represents a image and its class of pathological diagnosis. 
Here are an example:

    image_dir_00001.jpg	low_grade_adenoma
    image_dir_00002.jpg	hyperplastic_polyp
    image_dir_00003.jpg	sessile_serrated_lesion
    ...

### Label-II: Object-level Segmentation Mask

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/video_v2-min.gif"/> <br />
</p>

In polyp-existing frames, each polyp is annotated with a segmentation mask as shown above. 

The annotation is in `./data/DATASET/GT/`. Each image's name has direct correspondance with the annotation file name. 
For example, the segmentation mask for `image_dir_00001.jpg` is `image_dir_00001.png`.

### Label-III: Bounding Box

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/bbox-min.gif"/> <br />
</p>

We present the bounding box annotation for each polyp-existing frame. 
In `./data/DATASET/bbox_annotation.json` file, we follow the same format as COCO dataset. 

Here are an example:

```
{
    'info': {
        'year': 2021, 
        'version': 'v1.0', 
        'description': 'SUN Colonoscopy Video Database. Hayato et al, 2020.', 
        'contributor': '', 
        'url': '', 
        'date_created': ''}, 
    'images': [{
        'id': 'case1_1-a2-image0001', 
        'width': 1158, 
        'height': 1008,
        'case_name': 'case1_1'  # case_name means the name of case in the folder.
        'file_name': 'case_M_20181001100941_0U62372100109341_1_005_001-1_a2_ayy_image0001'}, # file_name is corresponding to the image name in the folder. 
        ...], 
    'annotation': [{
        'id': 'case1_1-a2-image0001', 
        'bbox': [262, 72, 68, 81]},  # Each element represnets the [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y].
        ...]
}

```

### Label-IV: Weak-labels with Edge/Polygon/Scribble

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/weak-min.gif"/> <br />
</p>

We present the scribble/polygon label for each polyp-existing frame.

The annotation is in `./data/DATASET/Edge/`, `./data/DATASET/Scribble/`, and `./data/DATASET/Polygon/`, respectively. Each image's name has direct correspondance with the annotation file name. 
For example, the label for `image_dir_00001.jpg` is `image_dir_00001.png`.

For each test image, predict the object mask or bounding boxes.
The evaluation is conducted with the segmentation mask in `./GT/` or the bounding boxes in `./bbox_annotation.json` respectively.

## Attributes Description

Next, we provide the complete attributes for our SUN-SEG dataset.
