![](https://drive.google.com//uc?export=view&id=1RU6kIRn3ZcZiI1sw4WA19mBQkqAt851U)

[Task Description]
The VPS158 dataset including 49,136 polyp frames (postive part) and 109,554 non-polyp frames (negative part) taken from 
different 285 and 728 colonoscopy videos clips, which were densely annotated with diversified labels for each frame, 
such as object-level segmentation mask, bounding box, edge, category, attribute, and three weak label (ie. scribble , 
polygon, ellipse). More details refer to SUN dataset: http://sundatabase.org/

## Data Format

The file formats of images, and bounding boxoes are jpeg and a text file, respectively.

```

The `Frame` folder contains the frames and the rest folders contain the corresponding ground truth. 
As for the `bbox_annotation.json` and `./Classfication` text file, we follow the same format as COCO and ImageNet for generality.

## Statistics

![](assets/statistic.png)

### Positive Part

- The positive part of VPS158 has 285 video clips (30 fps), which has 49,136 frames totally.

- Details of polyp samples refer to `./assets/positive_samples_table.md`

### Negative Part

- The negative part of VPS158 has 728 video clips (30 fps), which has 109,554 frames totally.

- Details of non-polyp samples refer to `./assets/negative_samples_table.md`

## Task Description

We provide diversified labels for facilitating different computer vision tasks in the medicine.

### Task-I: Pathological Diagnosis Classification (PDC)

![](https://drive.google.com//uc?export=view&id=1-YngZAggvV4rmDaIxYisZTq1o4Y-deQN)

Here are seven classes of pathological diagnosis:

- Low-grade adenoma (229 videos, 39834 frames)
- High-grade adenoma (26 videos, 4111 frames)
- Hyperplastic polyp (10 videos, 1644 frames)
- Traditional serrated adenoma (9 videos, 1627 frames)
- Sessile serrated lesion (8 videos, 1288 frames)
- Invasive carcinoma (3 videos, 632 frames)
- Non-Polyp (728 videos, 109,554 frames)

The annotation is in `./dataset/Classification/train.txt` and `./dataset/Classification/test.txt`. 
In the text file, each row represents a image and its class of pathological diagnosis. 
Here are an example:

    image_dir_00001.jpg	low_grade_adenoma
    image_dir_00002.jpg	hyperplastic_polyp
    image_dir_00003.jpg	sessile_serrated_lesion
    ...

### Task-II: Video Polyp Segmentation (VPS)

![](https://drive.google.com//uc?export=view&id=1fZM3IjotYjOdvOpKH1Zt6shM59CPj0Vy)

In polyp-existing frames, each polyp is annotated with a segmentation mask as shown above. 

The annotation is in `./dataset/GT/`. Each image's name has direct correspondance with the annotation file name. 
For example, the segmentation mask for `image_dir_00001.jpg` is `image_dir_00001.png`.

### Task-III: Video Polyp Detection (VPD)

![](https://drive.google.com//uc?export=view&id=1GH2gZefLWq5Zvz1SPtgrOpqO8kgSJ0rx)

We present the bounding box annotation for each polyp-existing frame. 
In `./dataset/bbox_annotation.json` file, we follow the same format as COCO dataset. 

Here are an example:

```
{
    'info': {
        'year': 2021, 
        'version': 'v1.0', 
        'description': 'SUN Colonoscopy Video Database. Hayato et al, 2020.', 
        'contributor': '', 
        'url': '', 
        'date_created': ''}, 
    'images': [{
        'id': 'case1_1-a2-image0001', 
        'width': 1158, 
        'height': 1008,
        'case_name': 'case1_1'  # case_name means the name of case in the folder.
        'file_name': 'case_M_20181001100941_0U62372100109341_1_005_001-1_a2_ayy_image0001'}, # file_name is corresponding to the image name in the folder. 
        ...], 
    'annotation': [{
        'id': 'case1_1-a2-image0001', 
        'bbox': [262, 72, 68, 81]},  # Each element represnets the [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y].
        ...]
}

```

### Task-IV: Weakly-Supervised Video Polyp Segmentation/Detection (WVPS/D) with edge/polygon/scribble labels

![](https://drive.google.com//uc?export=view&id=1GbYy2OY3REHKJjadqh3G_tinVsH4gP13)

We present the scribble/polygon label for each polyp-existing frame.

The annotation is in `./dataset/Edge/`, `./dataset/Scribble/`, and `./dataset/Polygon/`, respectively. Each image's name has direct correspondance with the annotation file name. 
For example, the label for `image_dir_00001.jpg` is `image_dir_00001.png`.

For each test image, predict the object mask or bounding boxes.
The evaluation is conducted with the segmentation mask in `./GT/` or the bounding boxes in `./bbox_annotation.json` respectively.

## Attributes Description

We also provide the attribute label for each frame including:
