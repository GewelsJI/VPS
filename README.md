# Features

- **VPS Dataset:** We recognize the importance of annotated medical data for substantial progress in research on medical AI systemsâ€™ development. And thus, SUN-SEG is an open access, non-profit database of high-quality, large-scale, densely-annotated dataset for faciliating the colonoscopy diagnosis, localization, and derivative tasks. Our vision aims to provide data and knowledge to aid and educate clinicians, and also for the development of automated medical decision support systems. Please refer to [PageLink]().
- **VPS Baseline:** We propose a simple but strong baseline, which outperforms the cutting-edge polyp segmentation approaches and run in super real-time (170fps). We hope such baseline could attract more researchers to join our community and inspire them to develop more interesting solutions. Please refer to [PageLink]().
- **VPS Benchmark:** For a fair comparison, we build an online leaderboard to keep up with new progress of other competitors. Please refer to [PageLink](). We also provide a evaluation toolbox for VPS task.
- **Tracking Trends:** We elaborately collect a paper reading list to continuously track the latest updates in this rapidly advancing field. Please refer to [PageLink]().

Based on some necessary privacy-perserving considerations, we could not directly share the download link of ground-truth with you. And please inform us of your institution and the purpose of using SUN-SEG in the email. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us by e-mail (gepengai.ji@gmail.com). Thank you for your understanding!

We provide a out-of-the-box evaluation toolbox for VPS task, which is written in python style. You can just run it to generate the evaluation results on your custom apporach. Or you can directly download the complete VPS benchmark toolbox (including ground-truth, prediction map of each competitor, and evaluation toolbox code) at [PageLink](). 

- More instructions about **Evaluation Toolbox** refer to [PageLink]().
- Online leaderboard is public at PaperWithCode. We believe this is a fun way to learn about new research directions and staying in tune with our VPS community.
