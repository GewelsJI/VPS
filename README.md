# News

- [March/15/2022] Release the evaluation toolbox for VPS task.
- [March/14/2022] Create the project.

# Features

- We recognize the importance of annotated medical data for substantial progress in research on intelligent systemsâ€™ development. 
- **Open Access:** This is an open access, non-profit database of high-quality, large-scale, densely-annotated dataset, dubbed SUN-SEG, for faciliating video polyp segmentation (VPS) task. Our vision aims to provide data and knowledge to aid and educate clinicians, and also for the development of automated medical decision support systems.
