# Features

In the deep learning era, we present the first comprehensive video polyp segmentation (VPS) study. Over the years, developments on VPS are not moving forward with ease since large-scale fine-grain segmentation masks are still not made publicly available. To tackle
this issue, we first introduce a high-quality per-frame annotated VPS dataset. There are four features of our work:

- **VPS Dataset:** We recognize the importance of annotated medical data for substantial progress in research on medical AI systemsâ€™ development. And thus, our SUN-SEG dataset is an open access, non-profit database of high-quality, large-scale, densely-annotated dataset for faciliating the colonoscopy diagnosis, localization, and derivative tasks. Our vision aims to provide data and knowledge to aid and educate clinicians, and also for the development of automated medical decision support systems.
- **VPS Baseline:** We propose a simple but strong baseline, which outperforms the cutting-edge polyp segmentation approaches and run in super real-time (170fps). We hope such baseline could attract more researchers to join our community and inspire them to develop more interesting solutions.
- **VPS Benchmark:** For a fair comparison, we build an online leaderboard to keep up with new progress of other competitors. Besides, we provide an out-of-the-box evaluation toolbox for VPS task.
- **Tracking Trends:** We elaborately collect a paper reading list to continuously track the latest updates in this rapidly advancing field.

Notably, based on some necessary privacy-perserving considerations from SUN dataset, we could not directly share the download link of video dataset to you without the authorization. And please inform us of your institution and the purpose of using SUN-SEG in the email. Thank you for your understanding!

# VPS Baseline

This work is the extension version of our conference paper (Progressively Normalized Self-Attention Network for Video Polyp Segmentation) accepted at MICCAI-2021. More details could refer to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08468) and [Github Link](https://github.com/GewelsJI/PNS-Net)

# VPS Benchamrk

[insert a benchmark table]

We provide a out-of-the-box evaluation toolbox for VPS task, which is written in python style. You can just run it to generate the evaluation results on your custom apporach. Or you can directly download the complete VPS benchmark toolbox (including ground-truth, prediction map of each competitor, and evaluation toolbox code) at [`DownloadLink`](). 

- More instructions about **Evaluation Toolbox** refer to [`PageLink`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/tree/main/eval).

We also build an online leaderboard to keep up with new progress of other competitors. We believe this is a fun way to learn about new research directions and staying in tune with our VPS community.

- Online leaderboard is publicly avaliable at [`PaperWithCode`](). 

# Traking Trends in the VPS field

In order to better understand the development of this field and to help researchers in their research process, we build the paper collection of **119** colonoscopy imaging-based AI scientific researchs in recent **12** years. It includes several fields, such as image polyp segmentation, video polyp segmentation, image polyp detection, video polyp detection, and image polyp classification. We also list some interesting resources about human colonoscopy.
