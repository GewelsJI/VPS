# 1. Features

In the deep learning era, we present the first comprehensive video polyp segmentation (VPS) study. Over the years, developments on VPS are not moving forward with ease since large-scale fine-grained segmentation masks are still not made publicly available. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a long-awaited high-quality per-frame annotated VPS dataset. There are four features of our work:

- **VPS Dataset:** We recognize the importance of annotated medical data for substantial progress in research on medical AI systemsâ€™ development. And thus, our SUN-SEG dataset is open access, a non-profit database of the high-quality, large-scale, densely-annotated dataset for facilitating the colonoscopy diagnosis, localization, and derivative tasks. Our vision aims to provide data and knowledge to aid and educate clinicians, and also for the development of automated medical decision support systems.
- **VPS Baseline:** We propose a simple but efficient baseline, which outperforms the 13 cutting-edge polyp segmentation approaches and run in super real-time (170fps). We hope such a baseline could attract more researchers to join our community and inspire them to develop more interesting solutions.
- **VPS Benchmark:** For a fair comparison, we build an online leaderboard to keep up with the new progress of VPS community. Besides, we provide an out-of-the-box evaluation toolbox for the VPS task.
- **Tracking Trends:** We elaborately collect a paper reading list (:boom:[Awesome Paper List](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/blob/main/docs/AWESOME_VPS.md):boom:) to continuously track the latest updates in this rapidly advancing field.

    </em>
</p>

Notably, based on some necessary privacy-preserving considerations from the SUN dataset, we could not directly share the download link of the video dataset with you without authorization. And please inform us of your institution and the purpose of using SUN-SEG in the email. Thank you for your understanding! 

- How to get access to our SUN-SEG dataset? Please refer to [`DATA_PREPARATION`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/blob/main/docs/DATA_PREPARATION.md).
- If you wanna know more descriptions about our SUN-SEG dataset. Please refer to our [`DATA_DESCRIPTION.md`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/blob/main/docs/DATA_DESCRIPTION.md).

    </em>
</p>



There are three simple-to-use steps to access our project code (PNS+):

  ```bash
    conda create -n PNS+ python=3.6
    conda activate PNS+
    conda install pytorch=1.1.0 torchvision -c pytorch
    pip install tensorboardX tqdm Pillow==6.2.2
    pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/tnt.git@master

# 5. VPS Benchmark

We provide an out-of-the-box evaluation toolbox for the VPS task, which is written in Python style. You can just run it to generate the evaluation results on your custom approach. Or you can directly download the complete VPS benchmark including prediction map of each competitor at download link: [OneDrive](https://anu365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/u7248002_anu_edu_au/ESS2WHOQvLhMl5ci8wNO6yYBjnh6EVcp5vYO1z4JoOKUNg?e=nJe6Zi) / [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Qu-0l9w0ja92nzrlWMRhoQ) (Password: 2t1l, Size: 5.45G).

- More instructions about **Evaluation Toolbox** refer to [`PageLink`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/tree/main/eval).

We also build an online leaderboard to keep up with the new progress of other competitors. We believe this is a fun way to learn about new research directions and stay in tune with our VPS community.

- Online leaderboard is publicly avaliable at PaperWithCode: [SUN-SEG-Easy](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sun-seg-easy) & [SUN-SEG-Hard](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sun-seg-hard).

Here, we present a variety of qualitative and quantitative results of VPS benchamrk:

# 6. Tracking Trends

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/the-reading-list.png"/> <br />
</p>

To better understand the development of this field and to quickly push researchers in their research process, we elaborately build a **Paper Reading List**. It includes **119** colonoscopy imaging-based AI scientific research in recent 12 years. It includes several fields, such as image polyp segmentation, video polyp segmentation, image polyp detection, video polyp detection, and image polyp classification. Besides, we will provide some interesting resources about human colonoscopy. 

> **Note:** If we miss some treasure works, please let me know via e-mail or directly push a PR. We will work on it as soon as possible. Many thanks for your active feedbacks.
