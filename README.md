# 1. Features

In the deep learning era, we present the first comprehensive video polyp segmentation (VPS) study. Over the years, developments on VPS are not moving forward with ease since large-scale fine-grain segmentation masks are still not made publicly available. To tackle
this issue, we first introduce a high-quality per-frame annotated VPS dataset. There are four features of our work:

- **VPS Dataset:** We recognize the importance of annotated medical data for substantial progress in research on medical AI systemsâ€™ development. And thus, our SUN-SEG dataset is open access, a non-profit database of the high-quality, large-scale, densely-annotated dataset for facilitating the colonoscopy diagnosis, localization, and derivative tasks. Our vision aims to provide data and knowledge to aid and educate clinicians, and also for the development of automated medical decision support systems.
- **VPS Baseline:** We propose a simple but strong baseline, which outperforms the cutting-edge polyp segmentation approaches and run in super real-time (170fps). We hope such a baseline could attract more researchers to join our community and inspire them to develop more interesting solutions.
- **VPS Benchmark:** For a fair comparison, we build an online leaderboard to keep up with the new progress of other competitors. Besides, we provide an out-of-the-box evaluation toolbox for the VPS task.
- **Tracking Trends:** We elaborately collect a paper reading list to continuously track the latest updates in this rapidly advancing field.


# 2. News

Notably, based on some necessary privacy-preserving considerations from the SUN dataset, we could not directly share the download link of the video dataset with you without authorization. And please inform us of your institution and the purpose of using SUN-SEG in the email. Thank you for your understanding! 

- How do get access to our SUN-SEG dataset? Please refer to [`DATA_PREPARATION`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/blob/main/docs/DATA_PREPARATION.md).
- If you wanna know more descriptions about our SUN-SEG dataset. Please refer to our [`DATA_DESCRIPTION.md`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/blob/main/docs/DATA_DESCRIPTION.md).


# 4. VPS Baseline


This work is the extension version of our conference paper (Progressively Normalized Self-Attention Network for Video Polyp Segmentation) accepted at MICCAI-2021. More details could refer to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08468) and [Github Link](https://github.com/GewelsJI/PNS-Net)


# 5. VPS Benchmark

[insert a benchmark table]

We provide an out-of-the-box evaluation toolbox for the VPS task, which is written in python style. You can just run it to generate the evaluation results on your custom approach. Or you can directly download the complete VPS benchmark toolbox (including ground-truth, prediction map of each competitor, and evaluation toolbox code) at [`DownloadLink`](). 

- More instructions about **Evaluation Toolbox** refer to [`PageLink`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/tree/main/eval).

We also build an online leaderboard to keep up with the new progress of other competitors. We believe this is a fun way to learn about new research directions and stay in tune with our VPS community.

- Online leaderboard is publicly avaliable at [`PaperWithCode`](). 

# 6. Tracking Trends

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/the-reading-list.png"/> <br />
</p>

In order to better understand the development of this field and to help researchers in their research process, we build the comprehensive **Paper Reading List**. It includes **119** colonoscopy imaging-based AI scientific research in recent **12** years. It includes several fields, such as image polyp segmentation, video polyp segmentation, image polyp detection, video polyp detection, and image polyp classification. We also list some interesting resources about human colonoscopy.

- The latest paper reading list and some interesting resources refer to [`Awesome-Video-Polyp-Segmentation.md`](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS/blob/main/docs/AWESOME_VPS.md)
